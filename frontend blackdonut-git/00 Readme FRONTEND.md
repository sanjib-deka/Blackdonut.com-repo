Frontend

The goal is to deliver a fast, smooth, and intuitive experience, especially for users discovering restaurants through reels, images, and interactive content.

Although the platform is currently web-only, the frontend architecture is built in a way that can be extended into a mobile app in the future without needing a full redesign.
