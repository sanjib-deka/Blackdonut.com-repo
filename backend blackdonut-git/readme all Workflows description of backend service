Backend
This backend powers a dual-panel platform for Users and Food Partners, designed with a modular, scalable, and secure architecture. Both panels operate on separate controllers, routes, and business logic, enabling clean separation of responsibilities and independent feature expansion.

The system is optimized for modern food discovery experiences, combining media-rich content, authentication workflows, and role-based features to support a fast-growing platform.

⭐ Key Features
🔹 1. Dual-Panel Backend Architecture

Dedicated backend logic for Users and Food Partners.

Independent controllers, route groups, and validation layers.

Makes the system easy to maintain, scale, and extend in the future.

🔹 2. Secure Authentication & Token Management

JWT Token is mandatory and required for all protected actions.

Ensures secure session control and strict role-based access.

Token-based Forgot Password system:

Issues a secure reset token.

Token is considered valid only after the reset link is clicked.

Follows strong security standards and best practices.

🔹 3. Media Handling System

Reels / Videos processed and optimized through ImageKit for fast delivery.

Images handled through Cloudinary with responsive transformations.

Architecture is ready to migrate to AWS S3, CloudFront, and Lambda for enterprise-level scaling.

🔹 4. Food Partner Capabilities

Complete profile management (update details, change photos, modify information).

Ability to upload promotional reels, images, and business media.

Enhances visibility and builds trust with local users.

🔹 5. User Experience Features

Users can explore restaurants through reels, images, menus, and location data.

Comment system for ratings and interaction.

Can directly contact restaurants or view detailed profiles.

🔹 6. Comment System (Role-Separated)

Different logic for:

User → Restaurant comments

Food Partner → User or platform interactions

Prevents data overlap and ensures clean identity validation.

🔹 7. Future-Ready Feature Roadmap

Geo-based Reel Feed:
Fetch and display restaurant videos from the user’s nearby area for improved reach and engagement.

Full Food Ordering System:
Menus, cart, checkout, and order tracking.

Advanced Profiles:
Analytics for food partners, preferences for users.

Push notifications, restaurant dashboards, live order updates, and more.

💼 Scalability & Growth Potential

The backend is designed with scalability in mind, using modular architecture, clean code separation, and cloud-ready components.
As more restaurants and users join the platform, the system can expand to:

Cloud-hosted microservices

Geo-distributed CDN

High-volume media uploads

Real-time interactions

This structure positions the platform for growth, partnerships, and potential sponsorships as the ecosystem expands and gains traction.

🔧 Backend Responsibilities

Expose secure REST APIs for all app operations.

Validate JWT tokens for every protected action.

Manage media uploads and CDN-based video streaming.

Handle authentication, authorization, and role-based access.

Execute business logic for both panels.

Provide secure, optimized communication with the database.

Support future upgrades without breaking existing functionality.
